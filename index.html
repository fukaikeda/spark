                Solar and battery developers spend significant time gathering critical information like zoning rules, 
                permitting hurdles, and historical records. In the United States, there are 3000+ counties, 10,000+ 
                building permit jurisdictions and more than 2,000 energy-regulating entities - each with their own 
                set of rules [Source: <a href="https://sparknotes.beehiiv.com/p/beyond-chatgpt-why-renewable-energy-needs-specialized-ai">SparkAI</a>]. 
                Spark AI currently compiles this data into static reports, which are 
                executive summaries with useful information for developers. <br>
                <br>
                However, these reports can't capture every data point, and manually navigating them remains inefficient.
                To resolve this issue, our team was asked to design SparkGPT — a new interactive search feature inside of 
                Spark's web platform that coexists with the report. Using SparkGPT, users can ask nuanced questions and 
                quickly receive verified, cited answers, bridging the gap between raw data and the high level insights 
                captured in the report.

                    <h3>Key Ideas</h3>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Two possible user workflows:</li>
                        <ul>
                            <li>(1) SparkGPT is integrated into the Reports feature, and each chat is linked to a specific report.</li>
                            <li>(2) SparkGPT is a standalone feature on the SparkAI webpage. </li>
                        </ul>
                        <li>Incorporating a side-by-side or top-bottom view of both the chat and the report</li>
                        <li>Allowing users to dig deeper into citations sourced for SparkGPT's response </li>

                    <h4>Home Screen</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Explored two design philosophies:</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li><strong>Design #2:</strong> Information-dense, landing page style</li>
                        <li><strong>Designs #1 & #4:</strong> Modern, minimalist aesthetic (aligned with current SparkAI design)</li>
                      </ul>
                      <li>Group discussed whether SparkGPT warranted a full homepage redesign or a lighter touch.</li>
                      <li><strong>Final decision:</strong> Iterative enhancement using the minimalist design for smoother integration.</li>
                    </ul>
                  
                    <h4>Chat Screen</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Continued the modern minimalist approach seen in leading AI chat interfaces.</li>
                      <li>Design aligned with success metrics from the client’s blurb:</li>
                      <ul>
                        <li>Users should be able to query and receive actionable information to inform energy project decisions.</li>
                      </ul>
                      <li>Included suggestion buttons for prompting example questions and guiding user interaction.</li>
                    </ul>
                  
                    <h4>Expanded Chat Screen</h4>
                    <ul>
                      <li>Created in response to client feedback emphasizing source transparency.</li>
                      <li>Introduced split-screen layout for comparing SparkGPT responses with original source documents.</li>
                      <li><strong>Design #3 innovation:</strong> A small search button on the Reports page to launch SparkGPT.</li>
                      <li>Client later noted this could cause confusion (seeming like a generic search tool instead of a chat interface).</li>
                      <li>These iterations helped highlight which sketches best advanced the product vision.</li>
                    </ul>

            <p class="paragraph">Next, we consolidated our sketches into three wireframe screens. <br>
                <br>

                For our final version of the Menu Viewer wireframe, we took elements from Design 3 and 
                decided to have SparkGPT be an integrated feature in the Reports section rather than a 
                standalone feature so that chats can be linked to specific reports. The Report & Chat 
                wireframe took inspiration from designs 1, 3, and 4, implementing some variation of 
                side-by-side reports and chat view, which would allow users to scan through the report 
                and ask questions simultaneously. Lastly, the Citation & Chat wireframe combined both 
                Design 2 and Design 3, which highlighted the importance of linking to SparkGPT's answers 
                to the original citations.<br>

                <p class="paragraph">We presented the previous wireframes in a live session with 
                    SparkAI and received actionable feedback, especially around citation clarity 
                    and integration points. Based on feedback we received from the Spark AI team, 
                    we made the following key adjustments to our design for the final, high-fidelity
                     prototype:</p>

                <ul>
                    <li>Two Entry Points:</li>

                                <li>Users click “SparkGPT,” pick a report (e.g. Lancaster, PA), and ask questions
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        <li>2. From a Report Page</li>

                                <li>Users click a chat icon to open SparkGPT next to their current report
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                    </ul>
                    <li>Searchable Chat Log Feature</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Added a search bar for SparkGPT histories, helping users find previous answers quickly
