            <p class="paragraph">In this page, we will be looking at the user interface of the <b>3D Printers</b> in
            the Brown Design Workshop, a student makerspace.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <p class="highlight" id="introduction">Introduction</p>
            <p class="paragraph">The <b><a href="browndesignworkshop.org">Brown Design Workshop</a></b> is a makerspace 
                located in Brown University's engineering building, open to all. It's ususally busy with students and community
                members realazing their creative ambitions. <br>
                <br>
                Although it is a very exciting space, it has over 1000 members and this means the place
                is often very busy and welcomes a variety of users. Sometimes, as a monitor, I notice users
                have issues in the interaction with different components. <br>
                <br>
                Therefore, I decided to look into the interaction and evaluating the users needs, to 
                help us find a long-term solution for increasing usability.

        <div class="section">
            <p class="highlight" id="prusa">The Prusa Interface</p>
            <div class="image-container">
                <img src='images/prusa.png' 
                alt="Image of a Prusa 3D Printer with labels on the different interactive elements">
            </div>
            <p class="paragraph"> One concern I had after interaction with the interface itself
                is how many of the settings are 'bundled' together, and the difficult callibration
                settings are often mixed up with the print settings, which may provide a 'black hole'
                experience for the beginning users.

        <div class="section">
            <p class="highlight" id="observations">Recording Observations </p>
            <p class="paragraph">Based on the initial discoveries I had with the Prusa printer
                itself, I decided that my observations were going to be of three different users:
                a beginning, intermediate, and advanced users. By observing the actions of each
                level of user, I could get insight into a variety of experiences.
            </p>
        </div>

        <div class="section">
            <p class="highlight" id="personas">Personas</p>
            <p class="paragraph">As mentioned in the last section, these users have such different experiences. Therefore, I begin to focus on a more
                niche user. I do this by creating two personas based on the observations I conducted. They are both beginners,
                but have different struggles.</p>
        </div>
        <div class="section">
            <p class="highlight" id="story">Storyboarding</p>
            <p class="paragraph">Then, I focus even more on a specific user by taking their journey and storyboarding it. This 
                process allows us to understand the specific points in a user's journey and their emotions in each,
            highlighting key points of improvement. </p>
        </div>

        <p class="highlight" id="reflection">Reflections</p>
            <p class="paragraph">This activity helped me understand the different users of the 3D printers in
                the BDW and how each users interacts with them. Particularly, reviewing the users that are in
                a category the 'furthest away' from us helped me realize what changes are needed to make the
                technology useful for everyone.<br>
                <br>
                While software changes are difficult to implement on my level, there are a variety of 
                methods for myself to be involved in increasing the usability, such as providing more directed
                education during workshops, creating signage to help users, and be avaliable to answer questions. 
                I want to implement these changes to make the 3DP experience better for a wide audience.
